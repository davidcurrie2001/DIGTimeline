1	Discussion paper	In 1988 Carlberg and F&oslash;yn wrote an ICES discussion paper titled 'Stimulated Growth and Safeguarding of the ICES Oceanographic Data Bank. A Discussion Paper'. 'During a number of years there has been a consent to build up and increase the ICES oceanographic data base to the benefit of the member countries.'	https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/CM%20Doccuments/1988/C/1988_C16.pdf	1988/01/01		policy	T
2	"Status, rules and procedures"	"In 1994 ICES (CM 1994 Del-10) summarised the 'Status, and Rules and Procedures governing Oceanographic, Environmental, and Fisheries data bases maintained at the ICES Secretariat'"	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.24573632.v1	1994/05/17		policy	T
3	"Status, rules and procedures - follow-up"	A follow-up paper (CM 1994 Follow up to Del: 10) was also produced to '... inform the Committee about the procedures set up and used by the Secretariat for dealing with requests for access to the Fisheries data bases described in Del: 10 in the period since the Mid-term meeting.'	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.24573632.v1	1994/09/01		policy	
4	Proposals adopted	"In the 1994 ICES Annual Report 'With respect to the matter of rules and procedures governing data bases maintained by the Secretariat, there was consensus that the Council adopt the proposals put forward in Doc. C.M. 1994/Del:10 and the supplementary follow-up paper.'"	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.7552	1994/09/22		policy	
5	WGMDM - status of data policy	"From the 2001 WGMDM report: 'Data policy was mentioned. H. Dooley explained that the present data policy was actually from an ICES paper by Stig Carlberg (Sweden) intended to stimulate use of the ICES oceanographic databank. He stressed that free and open exchange of data is encouraged, but restrictions placed on the data by their collectors are respected.'"	https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/CM%20Doccuments/2001/C/C0901.pdf	2001/04/02		policy	
6	SGMID - status of data policy	"In 2004 SGMID said 'ICES last reviewed its data policy in 1994 and prepared a base document for ICES data policy (ICES C.M. 1994/Del: 10). Since 1994 new policies have been added, but does [sic] not always provide information why access to data is regulated.'"	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.19266134.v1	2004/03/31		policy	
7	BWGDDP	"In 2005 the Bureau Working Group Data Development Project (BWGDDP C.M. 2005/Del.04/05/01) said 'Timely, open access to data will add value and is thus crucial for the usability of the portal. ICES must develop a clear strategy on how to access distributed data. This involves policy as well as technical considerations. First-of-all, ICES must update its data policy, which is more than a decade old and no longer fully reflects the way the scientific community handles data. A proposal for updating the ICES data policy will be drafted by SGMID following its meeting in April, 2005. The policy must acknowledge that ICES is the repository and/or distributor of the data, but not the owner with whom data rights ultimately remain. The policy may require negotiations with data owners and, since there are variable proprietary periods, it will undoubtedly presume a complex, secure system for administrating access.'"	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.24573176.v1	2005/09/01		policy	
8	SGMID - drafting a new data policy	"In 2005 SGMID said 'It is widely recognised that ICES has to update its data policy, which is more than a decade old and doesn't reflect the way the scientific community is presently handling data. None of the key groups subject to the data policy - the ICES Data Centre, data contributors, and expert groups/external data users - is content with the current policy and the procedure to access data. SGMID was asked to provide a draft new ICES data policy for further consideration by the ICES community, as one of the main goals for its 2005 meeting.'"	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.19267004.v1	2005/04/11		policy	
9	BWGDDP - propose new data policy	"In 2005 BWGDDP proposed a data policy based on the SGMID proposal (C.M. 2005/Del.04/05/03). 'The objective of this policy is to serve the scientific community, and facilitate the production of advice and status reports by stating the conditions for data submission, access and use.'"	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.24573176.v1	2005/09/01		policy	T
10	ICES Delegates adopt new data policy	"In 2005 the ICES Delegates ('Report on Update of 1994 Data Policy') said 'In response to comments about data ownership and access, the BWGDDP Chair said that the global trend is to have data available in the public domain. Although agreeing that we must accept reality and protect the rights of data collectors/submitters, he said that we must also move to accommodate the wider interests. Following discussion, Delegates adopted the Data Policy, with some re-arrangement of words.'"	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.7440	2005/10/19		policy	
11	WGDIM propose new data policy	In 2012 WGDIM proposed a new Data Policy to resolve the following deficiencies in the existing policy: 'Implication of CCs [Creative Commons Licenses]. Separate data policies for Commercial Catch Data. Redistribution rights. Data quality statement and responsibilities. Data security statement. Glossary of terms'	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.8729	2012/05/23		policy	
12	ICES Delegates adpot new data policy	In 2012 (CM_2012_Del-02.1.1_SCICOM_Report) the revised Data Policy is reviewed by ACOM and SCICOM before the policy is agreed to be published as the Data Policy (2012 update).	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.24564820.v1	2012/10/24		policy	
13	DIG proposed data policy update	In 2016 DIG reviewed and proposed an update to the Data Policy.	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.8353	2016/05/23		policy	
14	DIG proposed data policy update	"In 2021 DIG proposed splitting the Data Policy into a combination of Data Policy and Data Licenses. '... a policy typically sets out a set of principles to guide decisions or achieve outcomes, while a license is a permission to do, use, or own something. Currently the ICES Data Policy encompasses both aspects. [...] DIG therefore proposed to separate out the license and data policy aspects for clarity, and better alignment with current practises elsewhere.' The revised policy was adopted by ICES Council."	https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.8224	2021/05/18		policy	T
15	DIG proposed data policy update	In 2025 DIG updated the definitions of 'Data Provider' and 'Data Owner' and added 'Data ownership does not transfer to ICES' statement for clarification. These changes were reviewed and accepted by SCICOM at their March 2025 meeting.		2025/03/01		policy
